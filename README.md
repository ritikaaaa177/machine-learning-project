# machine-learning-project
# predicts the heart failure possibility of people based on different conditions
# The algorithms used here are - decision tree classifier, K-nearest neighbor, naive bayes classifier
# Determined accuracy based on different classifiere and calculated confusion matrix
# For better visualization, used matplotlib which describes how many are prone to heart failure and how many people are not prone to heart failure
